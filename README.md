# 👋 About Me

I'm Krish Patel, a recent Computer Science graduate from Michigan State University with a minor in Business/Finance.  
I’m passionate about building efficient, scalable systems and tackling problems that require both algorithmic depth and user empathy.

I have industry and research experience spanning software engineering, WebAssembly, cloud deployment, and cybersecurity — and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think abstractly, design clean systems, and optimize for both performance and clarity.

- Deepening my understanding of scalable architecture, cloud CI/CD, and optimization techniques
- Writing clean, maintainable code in Python, C++, and JavaScript
- Leveraging Docker, WebSockets, and GCP to deploy real-time apps

# 📂 Projects

### 🖋️ [Interactive Rich Text Editor](https://github.com/KrishPatel198/rich-text-editor-msu)  
Capstone project compiled from C++ to WebAssembly using Emscripten. Enables real-time conversion between Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, and RTF with a custom formatting engine and live browser preview.

▶️ [Live Demo](https://krishpatel198.github.io/rich-text-editor-msu/)

### 🗓️ [Real-Time Group Scheduling Tool](https://final-exam-656037513299.us-central1.run.app)  
A When2Meet-style platform built with Flask, Socket.IO, MySQL, and vanilla JS/CSS, deployed with Docker on Google Cloud Run.  
Includes secure auth, invite-only access, and real-time grid-based collaboration (< 30 ms latency).  
Trained a TensorFlow model to suggest optimal times and exposed predictions via Flask REST. CI/CD pipeline runs on every push with smoke test validation.
